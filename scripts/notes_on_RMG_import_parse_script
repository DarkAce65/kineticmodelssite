WORKFLOW for the new parser for importing KMs from the RMG-Import Github Repo

Make an empty KineticModel, THEN:

Start with parsing for new Species given the Species in the imported files for a KM:
    - [SMILES | Adjacency List] -> Species
            - Adjacency Lists found in Thermo .py file and also in dictionary.txt
    - species-exists?  -- Consider using SMILES, InChi

Establish the "through" relationship for the SpeciesName
    - So that we know which name the KineticModel uses to refer to the Species

Add Transport Data

Add Thermo Data

Add Kinetics Data

Add Reactions?
